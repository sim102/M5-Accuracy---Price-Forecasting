# M5 Accuracy-Price Forecasting


## Introduction

In this project, we will predict the unit sales of various products sold in Walmart.
We are provided with five datasets, which is explained in https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data.
There are 10 stores (four in California, three in Texas and three in Wisconsin), 3 item categories (Hobbies, Household and Foods) and finally, 7 deparments (two for Hobbies, two for Household and three for Foods).

## Methods

The following steps are going to be taken:

1. Reduce the memory usage by downcasting the data.
2. Visualize and understand the data by item and store categories.
3. Melt, combine and encode data to better fit to the model.
4. Utilize a LightGBM model to predict the price of items.
5. Create a submission file.

Part 1 ~ 3 were committed by Kihyun and the remaining parts were committed by others.
